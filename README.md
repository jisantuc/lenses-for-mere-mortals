Lenses for Mere Mortals exercises
=====

This repo contains some exercises from [Lenses for Mere Mortals], a book on
optics written for Purescript 0.12. A lot of time has passed since Purescript
0.12, so I'm doing the exercises with a much more recent package set, spago,
`profunctor-lenses`, etc.

Why this book?
-----

Several reasons! I like Purescript for its haskelly syntax and type system and
simple development environment story. But also, LeanPub at least still [doesn't
have a bunch of books on optics], and this one is shorter than [Optics by
Example].

There are plenty of places around the internet where you can get good "getting
started"-level guides to optics, like the [Monocle docs] (Scala). You can also
see pretty fancy examples of what you can do if you really _get_ optics, like on
[Chris Penner's blog]. I think
this book is less fancy than examples cool things you can do once you're an
expert, shorter than [Optics by Example], and more example-driven than the
[Monocle docs]. It's a bit ad hoc, but that seems like a sweet spot to me.
